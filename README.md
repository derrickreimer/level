# Level

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/levelhq/level.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/levelhq/level)

Join the insiders list at [level.app](https://level.app) for periodic updates.

## Development Environment

You'll need to install the following dependencies first:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) ([version](https://github.com/levelhq/level/blob/master/mix.exs#L4))
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresapp.com/) 10
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Node](#nodejs) ([version](https://github.com/levelhq/level/blob/master/.nvmrc))

Run the bootstrap script to install the remaining dependencies and create your
development database:

```
cd level
script/bootstrap
```

If your local PostgreSQL install does not have a default `postgres` user,
define the `LEVEL_DB_USERNAME` and `LEVEL_DB_PASSWORD` environment variables
first in your shell environment:

```
export LEVEL_DB_USERNAME=xxx
export LEVEL_DB_PASSWORD=yyy
```

Then run the bootstrap script again.

Use the `script/server` command to start up your local server and visit
[`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### Node.js

This repository includes a `.nvmrc` file targeting a specific version of Node
that is known to be compatible with all current node dependencies. Things might work
with a newer version of Node, but the most guaranteed route is to install
[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and run `nvm install` from
the project root.

Then, be sure to run `script/bootstrap` to install node dependencies with the
correct version of node.

### Elm

Much of the front-end is powered by [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).
The Elm code lives in the `assets/elm/src` directory and the corresponding test files
live in the `assets/elm/tests` directory.

To run the Elm test suite, execute `script/elm-test` from the project root.


## Development Environment Alternative: Docker

If you prefer to contain the dev environment with Docker instead of installing
all Level dependencies by hand globally on your machine, you can
[install Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
and docker-compose and then run:

`docker-compose up --build` (or see [other options](./docker-compose.md))

Wait until Level starts, then visit
[`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.


## Documentation

To generate and view the project documentation locally, run the following script:

```
script/docs
```
